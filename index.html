    <h1>Wave Function Collapse</h1>
    <h3>What is that?</h3>

    <p>
      Wave Function Collapse is an algorithm that alows us to, for example,
      generate an image made of a tiling of smaller images with rules for which
      images may be adjacent. By guessing where we have to and updating our
      neighbors' legal options after each guess, we're able to generate a
      reasonable potential image. By identifying and correcting any eventual
      mistakes, we can assure the final product is a "legal" image.

    <h3>Uh huh... Yeah, I know some of those words...</h3>

    <p>
      Err, right. Yeah. This is more of a visua thing. Luckily, I have visuals!
